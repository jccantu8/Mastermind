# Mastermind

A command line implementation of the board game Mastermind. The rules are as follows:

Colors available: Red ("R"), Blue ("B"), Green ("G"), Yellow ("Y"), White ("W"), Purple ("P")

Exact matches will be represented by an "X"

There will be 8 turns per game

Correct color matches but not in the right place will be represented by an "O"

There must be an even number of games which will be chosen by player

Colors CAN be repeated

Scores will be displayed at the end of each game


The computer is especially limited in its ability to guess since it simply picks colors at random. This will be updated.
